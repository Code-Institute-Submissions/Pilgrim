 ## Mission
 Since one of the most memorable trips i have made was a pilgrimage in Spain(Camini Primitivo), i thought it would be great to create a hub where people can be tempted to try the same. There is loads of information about these walking routes, however it is all scattered pieces of information over different websites, most of them in different languages. This is how Pilgrim came to be. Centralization of information, ease in trying to discover new routes and an UI that isn't too stale or too flashy.

 #### The target audience:
 
 The funny thing about the pilgrimages is that you'll find loads of different kinds of people all doing the same thing. That is half the fun! However in the time of Instagram and Tiktok, it's the younger generation that tends not to know about these routes. They get swamped in information and distractions, so the information on the website needs to be transparant and upfront with what it wants to show. Certainly with the information being so dispersed, that leaves a job to be filled. It also helps that you don't have to spend alot of money if you don't want to.

Another big issue of our times is mental health. One of the best remedies to depression is actually walking/moving and sunlight. That, along with the effect of a tired body because of physical activities and working towards a goal (hopefully the end of the route) do wonders for the mind. Combine that with wonderful people to be met on the way and it's a perfect storm to get you out of that rut.

Ofcourse the routes are a logical destination for religious pilgrims, nature/culture enthousiasts and travellers who like a physical challenge.

### TL:DR
#### Target Audience
* 20-30 year olds, student and starters.
* People who'd like to get a little away time from society
* Culture Enthousiasts
* Nature Enthousiasts
* Goal-Oriented people who like a challenge

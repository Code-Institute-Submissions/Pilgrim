 ## Mission
 Since one of the most memorable trips i have made was a pilgrimage in Spain(Camini Primitivo), i thought it would be great to create a hub where people can be tempted to try the same. There is loads of information about these walking routes, however it is all scattered pieces of information over different websites, most of them in different languages. This is how Pilgrim came to be. Centralization of information, ease in trying to discover new routes and an UI that isn't too stale or too flashy.

 ### The target audience:
 
 The funny thing about the pilgrimages is that you'll find loads of different kinds of people all doing the same thing. That is half the fun! However in the time of Instagram and Tiktok, it's the younger generation that tends not to know about these routes. They get swamped in information and distractions, so the information on the website needs to be transparant and upfront with what it wants to show. Certainly with the information being so dispersed, that leaves a job to be filled. It also helps that you don't have to spend alot of money if you don't want to.

Another big issue of our times is mental health. One of the best remedies to depression is actually walking/moving and sunlight. That, along with the effect of a tired body because of physical activities and working towards a goal (hopefully the end of the route) do wonders for the mind. Combine that with wonderful people to be met on the way and it's a perfect storm to get you out of that rut.

Ofcourse the routes are a logical destination for religious pilgrims, nature/culture enthousiasts and travellers who like a physical challenge.

### TL:DR
#### Target Audience
* 20-30 year olds, student and starters.
* People who'd like to get a little away time from society
* Culture Enthousiasts
* Nature Enthousiasts
* Goal-Oriented people who like a challenge
 
 ### Welcoming the User
 The moment the user enters the page he/she will right away notice the map in the middle of the page. Right away questions will arise, "what is this for?" Not only do we indicate by text to go to the buttons at the top of the page, the page is structured so easily that in case the user wants to interact with the map, he/she is never more than 2 steps away from doing so. Altough there is a piece of text at the bottom of the page containing some information and storytelling elements about the Camino's, it's not a priority. The user can find all this at their own pace.

## User Experience
 Pilgrim tries to keep the User Experience as simple as pleasant as possible. Not too many options to go in. One could say the site is quite static and empty without interaction. That is as intended. The moment the user makes decisions is the moment information should pop up. To keep things clear only already existing elements on the website change. We do not add new ones. 
Some examples how we keep it simple: 

* Routes on top are comprised of multiple sections, visible by the icon next to the encompassing name
* Dropdown menu on mobile viewport
* Upon clicking one of the routes,  markers appear on the map, and the camera pans towards the route.
* Picture and text beneath the  map change depending on the route. They picture remains the same size and the text the same color.
